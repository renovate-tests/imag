/// As the backend defines how "iterating over all entries" is implemented, this type holds a
/// `PathIterBuilder` internally. This type is used to create new iterator instances every time the
/// "settings" for how the iterator behaves are changed. This basically means: If the PathIterator
/// is requested to not iterate over a directory "a" but rather its subdirectory "a/b", the
/// implementation asks the `PathIterBuilder` to create a new iterator for that.
///
/// The `PathIterBuilder` can then yield a new iterator instance which is optimized for the new
/// requirements (which basically means: Construct a new WalkDir object which does traverse the
/// subdirectory instead of the parent).
///
/// This means quite a few allocations down the road, as the PathIterator itself is not generic, but
/// this seems to be the best way to implement this.
